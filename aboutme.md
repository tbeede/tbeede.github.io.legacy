subtitle: Some true facts 
---

I'm a Software Developer from South Carolina who started as a QA tester writing code to automate repetitive, manual processes that were dipping into my team's development time. After saving my team and myself hours on daily testing tasks, I was hooked on programming and started focusing more on writing code. Now I'm a completely dedicated Software Developer and still very much enjoy automating repetitive processes as part of my work. I also contribute to web application development and dabble in various areas around the stack. I'm constantly learning and reading up on all the latest development technologies. 

In my free time, I play music whether it be drums, guitar, or using Logic Pro to create electronic music. I'm also a competent piano and bass player and love jamming with friends.
