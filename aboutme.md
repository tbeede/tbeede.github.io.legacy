I'm a Software Developer from South Carolina who started as a QA tester writing code to automate repetitive, manual processes that were eating up my team's valuable development time. After saving my team and myself hours on daily testing tasks, I was hooked on programming and started focusing more on writing code. Now I'm a completely dedicated Software Developer, and while I still enjoy automating repetitive processes as part of my work, I prefer to concentrate on web application development, dabbling in various areas around the stack. I love to learn, talk, and read up on all the latest development technologies.

***My History***

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you head over to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tbeede/) profile!
