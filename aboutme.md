---

I'm a Software Developer from South Carolina who started as a QA tester writing code to automate repetitive, manual processes that were dipping into my team's development time. After saving my team and myself hours on daily testing tasks, I was hooked on programming and started focusing more on writing code. Now I'm a completely dedicated Software Developer, and while I still enjoy automating repetitive processes as part of my work, I prefer to concentrate on web application development, dabbling in various areas around the stack. I'm constantly learning, talking, and reading up on all the latest development technologies. 

In my free time, I really enjoy playing music whether it be drums, guitar, or using Logic Pro to create electronic music. I'm also a competent piano and bass player and love jamming with friends.

***A note about my avatar . . .***

You may be wondering if that smiling guy in the top hat with a [churchwarden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchwarden_pipe) clenched between his teeth is me. I am sorry to say that he is not. He is Sherlock Holmes as portrayed by [Jeremy Brett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Brett), and is one of my favorite actors to portray the famous detective. Needless to say I admire Holmes's problem solving abilities and think he would have made a great programmer!
